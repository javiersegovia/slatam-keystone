# Slatam API

## Development

Start the project in dev mode with `docker-compose run dev`. You will have the app ready on `localhost:8080`.

If you want to use the **pgadmin** interface, you can use `docker-compose up dev pgadmin`

## Deployment

**This is a work in progress**

Using `docker-compose up api` you will have the node server running with pm2 on port 8080.
